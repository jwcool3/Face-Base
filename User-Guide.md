# **Face Matcher Application**

## **Program Overview and User Guide**

## **Introduction**

The Face Matcher application is a comprehensive tool for face detection, processing, and matching. It combines advanced facial recognition technology with web scraping capabilities to help users build and search face databases.

This guide provides an overview of the application's functionality and instructions for getting started.

## **Key Features**

1. **Face Detection and Analysis**  
   * Upload images to detect faces automatically  
   * Extract facial features including landmarks, age, and gender  
   * Process entire directories of images in batches  
2. **Face Matching**  
   * Match detected faces against a database of previously processed faces  
   * Filter matches based on pose, orientation, and similarity threshold  
   * View and compare matched faces with detailed information  
3. **Web Scraping**  
   * Crawl websites to automatically collect images  
   * Download images in configurable batches  
   * Resume interrupted crawling operations  
4. **User-Friendly Interface**  
   * Clean, intuitive GUI with image previews  
   * Visual overlays for facial landmarks, age, and gender  
   * Detailed match information and navigation controls

## **System Requirements**

* **Operating System**: Windows, macOS, or Linux  
* **Python**: Version 3.7 or higher  
* **Dependencies**: See requirements.txt (includes NumPy, OpenCV, InsightFace, etc.)  
* **Storage**: Sufficient space for face databases and downloaded images

## **Installation**

1. Clone or download the Face Matcher repository  
2. Install dependencies:  
    Copy  
   pip install \-r requirements.txt

3. Run the application:  
    Copy  
   python main.py

## **Using the Application**

### **Main Interface**

The application window is divided into three main sections:

* **Left Panel**: Displays the uploaded image with detected faces  
* **Center Panel**: Shows match information and details  
* **Right Panel**: Displays the matched faces from the database

The top toolbar contains buttons for the main operations:

* Upload Image  
* Match Face  
* Filter controls  
* Navigation buttons

### **Basic Workflow**

#### **1\. Building Your Face Database**

Before matching faces, you need to build a database of faces.

*Option 1: Process Existing Images*

1. Organize your images in a folder  
2. The application will automatically process these images when first run  
3. Processed faces will be stored in the database

*Option 2: Use the Web Scraper*

1. Select **Tools → Web Scraper** from the menu  
2. Enter a starting URL for the crawler  
3. Configure options as needed and click "Start Scraper"  
4. The scraper will download images and add them to your database

#### **2\. Finding Matches**

1. Click "Upload Image" to select an image containing a face  
2. The application will detect and display the largest face  
3. Click "Match Face" to find similar faces in the database  
4. Browse through matches using the "Previous" and "Next" buttons  
5. View match details in the center panel

### **Advanced Features**

#### **Filtering Options**

* **Filter by Pose**: Only show faces with similar head orientation  
* **Filter Forward-Facing**: Only show faces looking toward the camera  
* **Overlay Landmarks**: Display facial feature points on the images  
* **Overlay Age/Gender**: Show estimated age and gender information

#### **Configuration**

All application settings can be customized in the `config.ini` file:

* Database and folder paths  
* Detection thresholds and parameters  
* UI settings  
* Scraper and downloader options

## **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**

1. **No faces detected**  
   * Ensure the image contains clearly visible faces  
   * Try adjusting the detection threshold in config.ini  
2. **No matches found**  
   * Check if your database contains faces  
   * Try adjusting the similarity threshold  
3. **Slow performance**  
   * Large databases may cause slower matching  
   * Consider using a computer with GPU support for faster processing

### **Logs**

The application maintains detailed logs in the `logs` directory. These can be useful for diagnosing issues.

├── scraper/                   \# Web crawling functionality  
└── utils/                     \# Helper functions

### **Data Organization**

Copy

├── database/                  \# Face database JSON files  
├── images/                    \# Source images  
│   ├── faces/                 \# Images with detected faces  
│   └── no\_faces/              \# Images without faces  
├── cropped\_faces/             \# Extracted face images  
└── downloaded\_images/         \# Images from web scraper

## **Tips for Best Results**

1. **Image Quality**: Higher resolution images yield better results  
2. **Face Position**: Front-facing images with good lighting work best  
3. **Database Size**: Larger databases improve matching accuracy  
4. **Batch Processing**: Process images in batches for efficiency  
5. **Regular Updates**: Add new images to keep your database current

## **Privacy and Ethical Considerations**

* This application is designed for legitimate use cases  
* Always respect privacy and copyright when collecting images  
* Obtain proper permissions before using facial recognition  
* Comply with all applicable laws and regulations

## **Support and Development**

The Face Matcher application is designed to be modular and extensible. For technical support or to contribute to development, please refer to the project repository.
